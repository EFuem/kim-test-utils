# kim-python-utils

Helper routines for writing KIM Tests and Verification Checks

We are working on submitting this package to PyPI, but in the meantime it can be installed directly from GitHub via:
```
pip install --user git+https://github.com/openkim/kim-python-utils
```

### Looking for the query module?

The kim_python_utils.query module has been moved to its own repo at https://github.com/openkim/kim-query
